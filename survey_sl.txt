                            Program SURVEY_SL
                              28 April 2021

This program reads land survey data from a .PNTS file, and writes a
.INS.SL file with the 2D coordinates of all points for which locations
could be resolved.  The .PNTS file format is described in the PNTCALC_FILE
documentation file.  The .INS.SL file is intended to be read by the SLIDE
program, described in the SLIDE documentation file.

The command line options are:

  -IN <input file name>
  <input file name>

    Provides the input file name.  The ".pnts" mandatory file name suffix
    may be omitted.

    The second form of this command line option (without the "-IN"
    keyword) is only allowed when the input file name does not start with
    a dash.  When a command line argument does not start with a dash, it
    is taken as the input file name if the input file has not previously
    been specified.

    An input file name is required.  There is no default.

  -OUT <output file name>
  <output file name>

    Provides the output file name.  The ".ins.sl" file name suffix may be
    omitted.

    The second form of this command line option (without the "-OUT"
    keyword) is only allowed when the output file name does not start with
    a dash.  When a command line argument does not start with a dash, it
    is taken as the output file name if the input file was previously
    specified, but the output file not.

    The default output file name is the leafname of the input file without
    the ".pnts" suffix, with ".ins.sl" appended.

The .INS.SL output file will contain one VAR NEW command for each point
for which a 2D coordinate could be determined.  The variable name will be
the point name from the input file, and the data type will be COOR2D.  For
example, point "corner1" at (25.1,-37.2) will result in the following line
in the .INS.SL file:

  var new corner1 Coor2d 25.1 -37.2
