                              PNTCALC System
                               27 June 2021

The PNTCALC system calculates absolute coordinates of points from various
relative distance and angle measurements.  Such relative measurements
result from the use of a tape measure and a transit, for example.

The following resources from the PNTCALC subsystem are intended for
external use.  Pathnames are relative to the Embedinc software
installation directory:

  doc/pntcalc.txt

    This file.  High level description of the PNTCALC subsystem

  doc/pntcalc_file.txt

    Describes the PNTCALC file input format.

  com/test_pntcalc.exe

    Test program that reads a PNTCALC file and performs operations on the
    data.  This is mostly intended to aid development and testing of
    PNTCALC routines.

  com/survey_sl.exe

    Program that reads a PNTCALC file and creates a slide making program
    (slide.exe) include file with the resolved points.  See the SURVEY_SL
    doc file for details.

  doc/survey_sl.txt

    Documentation file for the SURVEY_SL program.

  lib/pntcalc.lib

    Linkable library.

  lib/pntcalc.ins.pas, lib/pntcalc.h

    Include files that define exported symbols in the linkable library, in
    Pascal and C.
